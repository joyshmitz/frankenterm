# Controlled Beta Feedback Loop (`ft-1u90p.8.7`)

Date: 2026-02-18  
Status: Preparatory spec while `ft-1u90p.7.7` (alt-screen conformance e2e) is still in progress  
Depends on: `ft-1u90p.7.7`, `ft-1u90p.8.1`, `ft-1u90p.8.2`, `ft-1u90p.8.3`, `ft-1u90p.7.5`, `docs/resize-performance-slos.md`

## Purpose

Define the controlled beta loop that combines objective telemetry with structured user feedback so rollout promotion decisions are based on both system behavior and user-perceived smoothness.

This document contributes the `ft-1u90p.8.7` deliverables:

1. beta cohort plan and feedback taxonomy
2. telemetry-to-feedback correlation dashboard contract
3. promotion/rollback decision rubric

## Beta Cohort Plan

The controlled beta maps to rollout cohort `C2` from `docs/resize-rollout-plan-wa-1u90p.8.2.md`.

### Cohort Construction

- Exposure target: 10-40% of active sessions (`C2` window).
- Hardware coverage: minimum representation from all tiers in `docs/resize-performance-slos.md` (`low`, `mid`, `high`).
- Workflow coverage: include at least one group for each:
  - editor-heavy (vim/tmux-heavy)
  - long-scrollback monitoring
  - high tab/pane churn
  - mixed font-size/zoom workflows
- Session duration mix:
  - short burst sessions (<30 min)
  - standard work sessions (30 min - 4 h)
  - long-haul sessions (>4 h)

### Run Windows and Sample Sufficiency

- Beta duration: minimum 14 consecutive days after `C2` entry.
- Daily minimum telemetry target:
  - >= 500 resize-class events
  - >= 50 alt-screen transitions
  - >= 30 sessions per hardware tier
- Feedback sufficiency target:
  - >= 40 categorized feedback items total
  - >= 10 items from each workflow group

If sample thresholds are not met, decision status remains `HOLD`.

## Feedback Taxonomy

All beta feedback must be tagged with exactly one primary category and optional secondary tags.

### Primary Categories

| Code | Category | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| `P1` | Perceived hitching | User reports visible lag/stutter during resize or font churn |
| `P2` | Visual artifact | User reports stretching, stale frame, tearing, blank region, or flicker |
| `P3` | Interaction break | User reports input lag, missed keystrokes, cursor jumps, or unsafe behavior |
| `P4` | Alt-screen regression | User reports broken vim/less/htop/tmux behavior during/after resize |
| `P5` | Stability incident | Crash, hang, watchdog emergency mode, or forced recovery |
| `P6` | Positive confirmation | User explicitly reports smooth behavior in a representative workflow |

### Mandatory Metadata per Feedback Item

- `feedback_id` (UUID)
- `reported_at_utc`
- `cohort` (`C2`)
- `hardware_tier` (`low`/`mid`/`high`)
- `workflow_group`
- `category_code` (`P1..P6`)
- `severity` (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`)
- `session_id` (or anonymized equivalent)
- `notes_md` (freeform operator note)

## Telemetry-to-Feedback Correlation Contract

Each feedback item must map to a telemetry window and relevant resize metrics.

### Correlation Keys

- `session_id`
- `pane_id` / `tab_id` where available
- `window_id` where available
- `event_time_bucket_utc` (1-minute bucket)
- `resize_transaction_id` when emitted by harnesses

### Required Telemetry Fields

- SLO lanes from `docs/resize-performance-slos.md`:
  - `m1_p95_ms`, `m1_p99_ms`
  - stage p95 latency: `scheduler_queueing`, `logical_reflow`, `render_prep`, `presentation`
  - artifact counts: critical and minor
  - crash/hang indicators
- Runtime pressure surfaces:
  - `storage_lock_wait_p95_ms`
  - `storage_lock_hold_p95_ms`
  - `cursor_snapshot_bytes_p95`
  - watchdog warnings and degradation tier transitions

### Dashboard Views (minimum)

1. **Cohort Health**
   - resize event volume by day, tier, workflow group
   - M1/M2 percentile trends vs thresholds
2. **Perception vs Telemetry**
   - feedback category counts overlaid with latency/artifact time series
   - top correlated telemetry spikes for `P1..P5`
3. **Regression Lens**
   - incidents with linked artifacts/log bundles
   - unresolved critical/high feedback items by age
4. **Confidence View**
   - positive confirmations (`P6`) vs negative categories
   - decision confidence score for GO/HOLD/ROLLBACK

### Artifact Outputs

- `evidence/wa-1u90p.8.7/beta_feedback_log.jsonl`
- `evidence/wa-1u90p.8.7/telemetry_feedback_correlation.csv`
- `evidence/wa-1u90p.8.7/cohort_daily_summary.json`
- `evidence/wa-1u90p.8.7/decision_checkpoint_<YYYYMMDD>.md`

## Decision Rubric (Promotion / Hold / Rollback)

Decisions are evaluated at fixed checkpoints (daily operational, weekly promotion).

### Hard No-Go Triggers (Immediate Rollback)

Any of the following forces `ROLLBACK`:

1. Any invariant breach from `docs/resize-no-regression-compatibility-contract-wa-1u90p.8.1.md` (`RC-ALTSCREEN-001`, `RC-INTERACTION-001`, `RC-LIFECYCLE-001` included).
2. Any critical artifact incidence > 0 in gate scenarios.
3. Crash/hang incident (`P5`) with confirmed resize/reflow causality.
4. `M1` p99 exceeds target by >20% in two consecutive checkpoint windows.

### Hold Conditions

Set `HOLD` when no hard trigger fired but confidence is insufficient:

- sample sufficiency thresholds not met
- unresolved `high` severity feedback older than 48 hours
- repeated `P1`/`P2` spikes without root-cause closure
- alt-screen conformance (`ft-1u90p.7.7`) not closed

### Promotion Conditions (`GO`)

Promotion is allowed only when all are true:

1. No hard no-go trigger fired during checkpoint window.
2. Sample sufficiency thresholds met.
3. SLO conformance within approved thresholds (M1/M2/M3/M4).
4. No unresolved `critical` or `high` feedback items.
5. At least 7 consecutive days of stable beta metrics before broadening exposure.

## Operating Cadence

- Daily:
  - ingest new feedback and classify with taxonomy
  - refresh telemetry correlation artifacts
  - publish daily checkpoint status (`GO`/`HOLD`/`ROLLBACK`)
- Weekly:
  - trend review across tiers/workflows
  - promotion decision review with approver sign-off

## Validation Commands

Use existing rollout/observability surfaces while this bead remains dependency-gated:

```bash
# Current rollout and health posture
ft status --health

# Resize/reflow relevant events and search surfaces
ft robot events --limit 200
ft robot search "resize OR reflow OR artifact OR watchdog OR emergency_disable" --limit 200

# Deterministic scenario replay for correlation checkpoints
ft simulate run fixtures/simulations/resize_baseline/resize_multi_tab_storm.yaml --json --resize-timeline-json
ft simulate run fixtures/simulations/resize_baseline/font_churn_multi_pane.yaml --json --resize-timeline-json
```

## Exit Criteria for `ft-1u90p.8.7`

1. Controlled beta runs collect statistically useful telemetry and categorized feedback.
2. Promotion decisions cite both objective SLOs and perception signals.
3. Findings are documented and feed final release guidance (`ft-1u90p.8.5`, `ft-1u90p.8.6`).
