# Rio Analysis Synthesis — Prioritized FrankenTerm Adoption Roadmap

Bead: `ft-34sko.7`

This report synthesizes all Rio mining outputs into a concrete adoption roadmap for FrankenTerm, and explicitly compares the result with the existing Ghostty and Zellij syntheses.

Inputs (Rio):
- `evidence/rio/INVENTORY.md` (`ft-34sko.1`)
- `evidence/rio/rendering-pipeline.md` (`ft-34sko.2`)
- `evidence/rio/terminal-core.md` (`ft-34sko.3`)
- `evidence/rio/runtime-event-loop.md` (`ft-34sko.4`)
- `evidence/rio/config-platform.md` (`ft-34sko.5`)
- `evidence/rio/performance-analysis.md` (`ft-34sko.6`)

Cross-comparison inputs:
- `docs/ghostty-analysis-synthesis.md` (`ft-3bja.5`)
- `docs/zellij-analysis-synthesis.md` (`ft-2bai5`)

## Executive Summary

Rio’s highest-leverage contribution is not “new terminal features,” but a coherent runtime shape:
- parser/terminal mutation is decoupled from rendering via wakeup events,
- render work is damage-aware and frame-paced,
- parser and cache hot paths are bounded and explicit,
- platform/config layering is field-merge based and operationally practical.

The best FrankenTerm strategy is a hybrid:
- keep Ghostty-grade coalescing discipline,
- keep Zellij-grade operability/policy/session rigor,
- add Rio-grade damage + frame-pacing + parser-guardrail mechanics.

## Prioritized Recommendations (Actionable, Mapped)

| Rank | Recommendation | Effort | Risk | Primary bead mapping |
|---|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | Canonical wakeup/coalescing contract across ingest -> detect -> render | M | M | `ft-1u90p.5`, `ft-1u90p.7` |
| 2 | Two-source damage model (terminal damage + UI damage) with partial present | M | M | `ft-1u90p.4` |
| 3 | Sync-update guardrails + adaptive batch thresholds by pane activity | M | M | `ft-1u90p.5`, `ft-283h4.4` |
| 4 | Memory budget controller for scrollback + glyph/image caches + queue buffers | M | H | `ft-1u90p.5`, `ft-1u90p.6` |
| 5 | Pane-churn benchmark matrix with p95/p99 wakeup-to-frame SLOs | M | L | `ft-1u90p.7`, `ft-1u90p.7.9` |
| 6 | Frame pacing policy: monitor-aware scheduling + occlusion gating + explicit fallback modes | S-M | L | `ft-1u90p.4`, `ft-1u90p.8` |
| 7 | Effective-config introspection (source-of-truth per field + strict validation mode) | S | L | `ft-1u90p.8`, `ft-vv3h`, `ft-x4bt` |

## 1) Quick Wins (Low Effort, High Value)

### 1.1 Standardize wakeup coalescing and queue observability
Rio pattern:
- backend emits wakeups (`RioEvent::Wakeup`) instead of direct draw,
- scheduler avoids duplicate render timer topics,
- frame work is naturally damped by pacing.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- enforce one coalescing contract for all high-rate event producers,
- expose queue depth, coalesced-drop count, and wakeup-to-frame latency metrics,
- require every high-rate queue to declare overflow behavior (`merge`, `drop-oldest`, `defer`).

Likely risk:
- medium; risk is over-coalescing and hiding causal signals if not instrumented.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.5`, `ft-1u90p.7`

### 1.2 Adopt Rio-style two-source damage merge
Rio pattern:
- terminal-core emits `Full/Partial/CursorOnly` damage,
- frontend independently tracks UI damage, then merges both before render.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- keep model damage and overlay damage as separate streams,
- merge at one render boundary,
- preserve “fallback-to-full” correctness behavior when damage certainty is low.

Likely risk:
- medium; partial updates can regress correctness without strong fixtures.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.4`

### 1.3 Add strict effective-config visibility
Rio pattern:
- config layering is clear in code (default/file/platform/CLI/env), but not strongly surfaced as a single machine-readable resolution artifact.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- `ft config resolve --format json` returning value + source for each field,
- strict mode that fails on invalid/unknown/platform-mismatched config keys,
- compatibility summary for operator/debug workflows.

Likely risk:
- low.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.8`, `ft-vv3h`, `ft-x4bt`

## 2) Strategic Improvements (Medium Effort, High Leverage)

### 2.1 Bounded parser envelope: synchronized updates + adaptive batching
Rio pattern:
- synchronized-update timeout and buffer cap are explicit,
- parser batching threshold and shrink policy are explicit.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- keep hard sync bounds,
- tune batch threshold by pane role (interactive vs bulk-output),
- add starvation guard for unfair lock fast paths.

Likely blockers:
- proving this does not regress latency tails on interactive panes.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.5`, `ft-283h4.4`

### 2.2 Unified memory budgeting across terminal/runtime/render caches
Rio pattern:
- bounded char/font/image caches,
- explicit history depth and clear-history path,
- bounded parser transient buffers.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- introduce global memory envelope with sub-budgets:
  - scrollback,
  - render caches,
  - transient ingest queues.
- tie policy to pressure states (`normal`, `constrained`, `emergency`) with deterministic degradation ladder.

Likely blockers:
- tuning policy without harming perceived quality.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.5`, `ft-1u90p.6`

### 2.3 Frame scheduler hardening with explicit pacing policy tiers
Rio pattern:
- monitor-derived vblank interval,
- `wait_until` pacing,
- occlusion-aware render suppression.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- scheduling policy per platform/workload (`latency`, `balanced`, `efficiency`),
- explicit fallback path for missed frame deadlines,
- attach pacing telemetry to go/no-go rollout dashboards.

Likely blockers:
- platform-specific behavior drift under non-default compositors.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.4`, `ft-1u90p.8`

### 2.4 End-to-end pane-churn performance test matrix
Rio gap discovered:
- strong microbenches exist, but no full pipeline pane-churn benchmark harness.

FrankenTerm implementation sketch:
- add end-to-end benchmark matrix:
  - high pane count,
  - rapid resize churn,
  - mixed interactive + bulk output,
  - memory-pressure cycles.
- enforce SLO gates on p95/p99 wakeup-to-frame and queue lag.

Likely blockers:
- deterministic benchmark reproducibility in CI.

Mapped beads:
- `ft-1u90p.7`, `ft-1u90p.7.9`

## 3) Future Considerations (Defer With Rationale)

### 3.1 Per-pane IO thread vs shared-reactor model experiment
Rio today:
- optional performer thread per context.

Why defer:
- FrankenTerm currently has higher-priority correctness and observability work in active tracks; concurrency architecture changes should be benchmark-driven and phased.

Revisit when:
- `ft-1u90p.7` has stable churn benchmarks and `ft-283h4.4` IO pipeline data is available.

### 3.2 Atlas lifecycle optimization (compaction/segregation)
Rio today:
- dual mask/color atlases with dirty upload and full clear on font-change events.

Why defer:
- useful, but second-order until frame/timing/memory telemetry proves atlas pressure as a dominant bottleneck.

Revisit when:
- cache-pressure observability from strategic items is live.

### 3.3 Rio-style config ergonomics beyond core runtime tracks
Why defer:
- operationally useful, but less urgent than resize/reflow correctness and throughput tracks.

Revisit when:
- `ft-1u90p` rollout stabilization reaches evidence-complete state.

## 4) Cross-Comparison: Rio vs Ghostty vs Zellij

### 4.1 Convergent patterns across all three (high-confidence bets)

1. **Bounded, coalesced event propagation beats per-event fanout**
- Ghostty: explicit coalescing and mailbox drains.
- Zellij: bounded queues with explicit degradation semantics.
- Rio: wakeup-based render triggering with scheduler dedupe.

2. **Performance depends on explicit budget boundaries**
- Ghostty: byte-budgeted memory discipline.
- Zellij: bounded queues and pragmatic backpressure.
- Rio: bounded parser/caches/frame pacing defaults.

3. **Operational clarity matters as much as raw speed**
- Ghostty/Zellij syntheses emphasize explicit contracts and observability.
- Rio highlights where this should attach in the render/event pipeline.

### 4.2 Divergent strategies requiring FrankenTerm-specific tradeoffs

1. **Hot-path concurrency model**
- Ghostty: tight coalesced hot path.
- Rio: per-context performer thread + locking/pacing.
- Zellij: subsystem message-bus model.

Decision for FrankenTerm:
- maintain coalesced hot path semantics while keeping subsystem boundaries auditable.

2. **Output representation and rendering boundary**
- Zellij favors frame-oriented server output.
- Ghostty and Rio focus on internal dirty/delta semantics.

Decision for FrankenTerm:
- keep structured pane-addressed deltas for robot/search workflows, and only materialize frame-level views where needed.

3. **Config/ops philosophy**
- Zellij is protocol/compat heavy.
- Rio is practical platform-merge and defaults focused.
- Ghostty synthesis emphasizes hot-path behavior more than operator config UX.

Decision for FrankenTerm:
- combine protocol compatibility rigor with Rio-like effective-config transparency.

### 4.3 Rio-unique innovations (no direct counterpart in prior syntheses)

1. **Synchronized-update safeguards with hard timeout and cap**
2. **Two-source damage merge (terminal + UI) as first-class render contract**
3. **Monitor-aware `wait_until` pacing integrated with route scheduler**
4. **Dual atlas + unified text-run cache architecture wired to dirty uploads**

These are the highest-value Rio-specific additions to the existing Ghostty/Zellij-informed roadmap.

## 5) Execution Order

1. Ship quick wins first (coalescing contract, damage merge, config introspection).
2. Land strategic observability and budget control in parallel with active resize/reflow tracks.
3. Use newly added performance evidence to decide on concurrency/atlas future work.
