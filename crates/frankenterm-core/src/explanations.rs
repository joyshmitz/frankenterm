//! # Usage
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use frankenterm_core::explanations::{get_explanation, render_explanation};
//! use std::collections::HashMap;
//!
//! if let Some(template) = get_explanation("deny.alt_screen") {
//!     println!("{}", template.brief);

//!     // With context interpolation
//!     let mut ctx = HashMap::new();
//!     ctx.insert("pane_id".to_string(), "42".to_string());
//!     let rendered = render_explanation(template, &ctx);

screen buffer. Sending text input to such applications can cause unpredictable
behavior or data corruption.

This factor adds significant weight (default: 60) to the risk score because:
- Applications like vim interpret text as commands
- Screen-based apps don't have a shell prompt

- 'DROP TABLE' or 'DROP DATABASE' (SQL destruction)
- 'git reset --hard' or 'git clean -fd' (git history/file loss)
- 'mkfs' or 'dd if=' (disk operations)

commands have broader system access and can cause more damage if misused.
