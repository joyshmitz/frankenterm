//! Global resize scheduler with frame-budget-aware work classes.
//!
//! This module provides the control-plane scheduler required by `wa-1u90p.2.3`.
//! It implements:
//! - bounded per-pane pending queueing (`<= 1` pending intent after coalescing)
//! - single-flight execution per pane (no concurrent active intents per pane)
//! - work-class-aware global selection (`interactive` vs `background`)
//! - frame-budget-aware scheduling
//! - starvation protection for background work via deferral aging
//! - input-first guardrails that reserve budget under interaction backlog
//! - cross-pane resize storm detection and deduplication (`wa-1u90p.5.3`)
//! - domain-aware throttling with per-domain budget caps (`wa-1u90p.5.3`)
//! - observability via scheduler metrics and snapshots
